The .gpx file for this map was pulled from my Strava account. The history of the Virginia Creeper Trail provided in the text box came from the Virginia Creeper Trail website https://vacreepertrail.com/. It is a relaxing ride that also passes through some residential areas and a golf course. It is a well-loved trail and you run into many types of people depending on what portion of the trail you are on. Starting on the trail in Damascus I passed quite a few people who seemed to be locals taking afternoon walks, then you get deeper into the natural areas and encounter more bikers and hikers, in the golf course area you pass older couples and families who seem to be on vacation.


I chose this route because it is a bike ride where I happened to take many photos therefore having accurate references for interesting points along the route. The Virginia Creeper Trail a great trail in an area with a distinctly Appalachian history, displayed in the scenery of rolling pastures with cows, railroad infrastructure and remnants of industry along a beautiful creek and occasional mountain landscapes.
